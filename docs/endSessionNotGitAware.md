# End Session: Non-Git-Aware Environment

## Instructions for User

You have completed a session in a non-Git-aware environment. Please ensure any significant new information or updates from our conversation are manually incorporated into your local Git repository files (e.g., `ProjectStatus.md`, `ActionItems.md`, new `SessionLog_YYYY-MM-DD.md` entry, etc.).

Remember to **manually commit and push your changes** to the Git repository to maintain continuity and prepare for future sessions.

Consider running the `endSessionGitAware.md` process from a Git-aware instance soon to update your `newSessionNotGitAware.md` file for future manual sessions.
