 * Debugging Session Summary - ForgitMeNot App (July 24, 2025 23:09 BST)
 *
 * Overall Objective: Successfully launch the Flutter web app in debug mode
 * within Codespaces and see `print` statements in the
 * VS Code "DEBUG CONSOLE".
 *
 * Initial Problem:
 * * The app would load in the browser, but `print` statements were not
 * appearing in the "DEBUG CONSOLE".
 * * Suspected that the browser instance being viewed was an old, unconnected
 * instance, not the one linked to the current debug session.
 * * The "Flutter: please click the Dart Debug extension button..." popup was
 * appearing, but no such button was found in the active browser window.
 *
 * Actions Taken (Troubleshooting Steps):
 *
 * 1.  Version Identifier Attempts:
 * * Initial idea: Add a dynamic timestamp to `main.dart` for visual
 * version tracking in the browser tab title.
 * * User Correction: Clarified that a *hard-coded, simple, static*
 * identifier was needed for unambiguous visual version control,
 * not a dynamic one.
 * * User Correction (again): Clarified that the identifier needed to be
 * *easily visible* within the main app page (e.g., in the `AppBar` text),
 * not in the small, potentially truncated browser tab title.
 * * Current State of `main.dart`: The `AppBar` title for `MyHomePage`
 * has been updated to `ForgitMeNot Home Page V1` to provide this clear,
 * static identifier.
 *
 * 2.  "Clean Debugging Sheet" Protocol Established:
 * * Goal: Ensure no old debug sessions or forwarded ports are interfering
 * with new launches.
 * * Steps:
 * * **Stop Debug Sessions:** Use the red square "Stop" button in the
 * "Run and Debug" view. (Initially, this sometimes left lingering processes).
 * * **Close Ports:** Manually right-click and "Terminate Port Forwarding"/
 * "Delete" on all listed ports in the "PORTS" tab.
 * * Recent Positive Observation: It appears that **stopping the debug instance
 * now *also* cleans up the ports automatically**, which streamlines this
 * process significantly.
 *
 * 3.  Recent Launch Attempt & Observations:
 * * After cleaning, a new debug session was initiated.
 * * **No "Select Debugger" popup** appeared (good).
 * * Text appeared in the "DEBUG CONSOLE".
 * * A "connecting to..." window appeared, followed by the familiar "spawned..."
 * message (indicating DevTools connection attempt).
 * * **No new browser tab opened automatically.**
 * * The "PORTS" tab showed a new forwarded port (indicating the debugger
 * *did* try to launch).
 * * When the port was manually opened (via popup or globe icon, after
 * ensuring Public visibility), it resulted in a **"404 Not Found" error**
 * in the browser.
 *
 * 4.  Process Check (`ps aux | grep flutter`):
 * * To understand why the 404 was happening, a process check was performed
 * in the terminal.
 * * **Result:** Only Flutter background/helper processes (daemon, analysis
 * server, DevTools) were found. **Crucially, no active process serving the
 * actual Flutter web application was listed.** This confirms that despite
 * the debugger seemingly starting, the web server for the app itself is
 * not launching or completing successfully.
 *
 * Current Status & Next Steps:
 *
 * * Problem: The Flutter web app is not correctly launching its web server,
 * resulting in a 404 when trying to access the forwarded port.
 * * Next Planned Action: Examine the **"OUTPUT" tab** in VS Code (specifically
 * the "Run" or "Flutter" channel) for detailed logs or error messages from
 * the `flutter run` command, which should indicate why the web server failed to start.
